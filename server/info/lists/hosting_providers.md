# Hosting Providers

The cost per gigabyte of RAM of the cheapest plan is listed beside the provider.  
? means the price varies based on your custom plan.  
The plans' cost is per month.  
Many people personally recommend a VPS (Virtual Private Server), but most are Minecraft plans here.  
This will go off of available plans, <BirdFlop has EU and US locations, but only US is available>.
