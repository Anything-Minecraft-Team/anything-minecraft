# Anti-Cheat Plugins

Here is a list of some anti-cheats, good or bad. Spigot has it's own [wiki page on anti-cheats](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/anti-cheat-list-bukkit-and-spigot/). This page is based on that list.

Generally speaking, paid anti-cheat plugins are better than free ones.

The ratings are from the [spiget api](https://spiget.org) average rating.

## Free Plugins

This list of free anti-cheats is sorted alphabetically.
