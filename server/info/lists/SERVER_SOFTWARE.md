# Server Software

Server software is the software that allows multiple players to play on a server together.

### Note

A * means that the developer of that project mass produces them. This leads to a lack of support, lack of updates, and quick abandonement.

### Plugins:

- [CraftBukkit](https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit) - It's the BASE for all forks that are out today and they still are updating it to this day, not newbie friendly at all because it requires manual building (or you can get it [here](https://getbukkit.org)). The only real use is for Minecraft versions from `1.0.0` to `1.4.5` as there is no Spigot release for these versions.  
Version: 1.0.0 - 1.16.5  
Currently Active

- [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) - The original fork of Bukkit. Spigot has improved performance vs CraftBukkit, still widely used. It's a recommended alternative if for some reason you don't want to use PaperMC.  
Version: 1.4.6 - 1.16.5  
Currently Active

- [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) - Most popular JAR for Spigot/Bukkit, quite fast and stable, they roll out small patches frequently, so it is a good choice if you're just starting with your MC server and don't have much experience.  
Version: 1.7.10 - 1.16.5  
Currently Active

- [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity) - PaperMC fork aimed at improving stability and performance at high player counts.  
Version: 1.13.2 - 1.16.5  
Currently Active

- [Purpur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/) - It's a fork of PaperMC with Tuinity and Airplane patches to deliver very fast performance with stability for high player counts and it adds a lot of custom features that aren't seen on any other forks.  
Version: 1.14.4 - 1.16.5  
Currently Active

- [Airplane](https://github.com/TECHNOVE/Airplane) - This fork includes optimizations oriented towards large servers.

DISCONTINUED

Only use if you desperately need performance and think it's worth the instability.  
Version: 1.15.2 - 1.16.5  
DISCONTINUED

- [Cuberite](https://cuberite.org/) - Cuberite is a server software developed in C++ and plugins are written in LUA. Cuberite is very lightweight and they also allow you to run a server on your android device! Cuberite is only 1.8-1.12, 1.13+ compatibility is being worked on.

Currently Active

- [MineStom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) - MineStorm is an entire recode of Minecraft servers from the base up meant to remove all vanilla features. It removes features like the server understanding what a chest is, which allows HUGE performance increases for minigame servers as they may not need that feature. Every feature can be added back. Due to this, development would take longer and would not be suitable for survival servers.
