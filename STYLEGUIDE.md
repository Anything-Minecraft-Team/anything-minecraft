# Style Guide

## File and directory names

File names should be all-uppercase and have no spaces but underscores and so do directories

## Decimal Separators

Use the decimal separators appropriate to the locale. For example, for `en_us`, ten thousand would be `10,000.00` but for `de_de`, it would be `10.000,00`
