# CraftBukkit JAR

## Overview

CraftBukkit was the first server jar to support plugins.
However, now it is the least optimized server JAR with plugin support.
It is currently being supported by SpigotMC after it shutdown in 2014 due to getting a DMCA takedown.
CraftBukkit is the closest you can get to vanilla Minecraft while being able to add plugins.
Do NOT use this for a public server if there are other options available.
CraftBukkit adds some more settings in a seperate config `bukkit.yml`. Some examples are the `spawn-limits` section that allows you to change the amount of entities that can spawn per world, `allow-end` which is very simple, is the End enabled?

Suggested versions: The suggested versions to use bukkit with is 1.0.0 - 1.4.5, any versions before 1.0.0 are illegal to distribute, the first version of SpigotMC was 1.4.6 so there's no general reason to use CraftBukkit over Spigot unless you want to see what CraftBukkit was like.
