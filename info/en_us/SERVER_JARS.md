# Picking a Server JAR

## What is a Server JAR?

<!---- [a server jar is blah blah something] --->

Here we will go into as much detail as possible about each server jar you can use for your server

### What is a fork?

Later, we will use the term "fork" often. A fork is an extension on an original piece of open-source software, allowing for additional functionality and changes. The term "upstream" is used to describe the original software which a fork is based upon.

Software can also be a fork of multiple forks. For example, Tuinity is a fork of PaperSpigot which is a fork of Spigot which is a fork of CraftBukkit which is a fork of the original Minecraft Vanilla server software.

## Server Jar Options

### [Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server)

Vanilla is the original server jar that is distributed by Mojang.
Plugins and mods are not supported on this.
Vanilla servers behaves like normal singleplayer Minecraft but with additional commands.

### [CraftBukkit](https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit)

CraftBukkit was the first server jar to support plugins.
However, now it is the least optimized server jar with plugin support.
It is currently being supported by SpigotMC.

### [SpigotMC](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot)

SpigotMC, or Spigot, is a fork of Bukkit with; better performance; more features; and allows you to connect servers with Bungeecord.

### [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)

PaperMC, or PaperSpigot, is a fork of SpigotMC. It aims to provide better performance, being updated more often than Spigot.
With this, PaperMC is able to patch bugs and exploits faster than SpigotMC.

<!---- REMOVED AS NOT BALANCED OPINION
A selection of added features and optimalizations:
-	Async chunck loading and saving
-	Timings reports
-	No-tick view distance
-	Several optimisations on TNT, hoppers and restone

### [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)

Tuinity is a fork of PaperMC that is "aimed at imporiving server performance at high playercounts"

### [Purpur](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur)

"Purpur is a fork of Paper and Tuinity with the goal of providing new and interesting configuration options."

<!----- REMOVED AS NOT BALANCED OPINION
Some of the features it adds:
-	Lots of tweaks for entities. For example: make all mobs ridable, change max health
-	Change mechanics. Such as: mine spawners with sulk touch, mending repairs most damaged equipment, totems of undying are working when only in inventory
-	Lots more

### [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)

Fabric is a modloader, similar to Forge but much more lightweight.
Growing in popularity recently, it also has some of the best QOL client-side mods, but also new and improved server optimizing mods.

## Proxies

Proxies are servers meant to connect multiple servers together, as a network. These servers can run on the same machine or even on different machines at different locations!
Running your server as a network can greatly improve performance, as Minecraft can spread the load over multiple cores.
However, it also adds complexity, as setting up and managing multiple servers isnâ€™t as simple as managing one server.

### [BungeeCord](https://ci.md-5.net/job/BungeeCord/)

BungeeCord is the original Minecraft proxy which "acts as a proxy between the player's client and the connected Minecraft servers". This allows players to seamlessly be transferred between different servers.

### [Waterfall](https://papermc.io/downloads#Waterfall)

Waterfall is PaperMC's fork of BungeeCord. It aims to provide stability, scalibility and more features. Similar to PaperMC, it has more frequent updates than BungeeCord.

### [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/)
"Velocity is a next-generation Minecraft proxy focused on scalability and flexibility. It allows server owners to link together multiple Minecraft servers so they may appear as one." Pretty much a much more optimized alternative to BungeeCord and Waterfall, although lacks out-of-the-box support for most BungeeCord plugins.
