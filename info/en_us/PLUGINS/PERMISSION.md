# Permission plugins

Permission plugins are important on every server; from a small server with friends to the biggest networks. With permissions you decide what you players can do, and what is permitted. In this document, you'll find a list of popular, good or noticeable permission plugins. The list is sorted form most common to least common.

## [Luckperms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/)

Luckperms is a widely used, community favorite, permissions plugin. It has more than 1 million downloads. It's a complete plugin, with a some strong functions. For example:

- A web editor, with a great overview and supporting bulk editing.
- Verbose system. It lists permissions of other plugins.
- Strong tab complete in-game

If you have a small server with straight forward permissions, you might want to look to an other plugin, as luckperms is really extensive.

## [GroupManager](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/groupmanager.38875/)
GroupManager is an plugin between Luckperms and Lightperms. It has more functions than Lightperms, but less then Luckperms. It's downloaded 400,000 times. It does support inheritance of permissions, but it has only one track.


## [LightPemrs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-8-1-16-lightperms.62447/)
