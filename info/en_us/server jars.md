# Intro

Here we will go into as much detail as possible about each server jar you can use for your server

## [Vanilla](https://getbukkit.org/download/vanilla)

Vanilla is the original server jar that is distributed by mojang. Plugins and mods are not supproted on this. Behaves exactly like normal singleplayer minecraft.

## [CraftBukkit](https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit)

CraftBukkit was the first server jar to support plugins. It is the least optimized server jar that has plugin support. It is currently being supported by SpigotMC.

## [SpigotMC](https://getbukkit.org/download/spigot)

SpigotMC is a fork of bukkit, it has better performance and more features, it also allows you to connect servers with bungeecord.

## [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)

PaperMC is another fork but this time its a fork of SpigotMC, it aims to get better performance out of spigot which it does amazingly.

## [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)

Tuinity is a fork of PaperMC that adds better performance

## [Purpur](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur)

Purpur is also a fork of PaperMC but has all tuinity's features. It is recommended to use this over all the other forks. It also has flying squids which is it's best feature.

## [YatopiaMC](https://github.com/YatopiaMC/Yatopia)

YatopiaMC has a bunch of features that could help make your server run faster but it has had some bugs that just break the game, it is not properly tested and doesnt have all of purpurs features. It is advised to not use this fork.

## [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)

Fabric is a modloader like forge but much more lightweight. Its growing in popularity. It also has some of the best fps improving mods for the client (See Sodium mod) and server.
