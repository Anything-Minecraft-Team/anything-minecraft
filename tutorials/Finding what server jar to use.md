### Intro
Here we will go through how to pick what server jar to use. A server jar contains all the code for the server, there are server jars for modloaders, like forge or fabric, and some that allow you to use plugins.

### Picking your server jar
The first step to finding the right server jar for you is to know what kind of server you want to run, is it survival, prisons, minigames and what minecraft version is it? We will show you some basic ones then you can look at (link to page of server jars) for more in depth explinations etc. 
1.13+ Survival server with plugins - A good server jar to use is [Purpur](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur), it optimizes performance a lot and adds a lot of features (FLYING SQUIDS :D) to help optimize even further or just some fun cool things to do.
