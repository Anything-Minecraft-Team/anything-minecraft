# Intro

This article aims to give you directions on how you can run and join your Minecraft server. This will all be done locally on your computer.

## Setup

The very first thing required in setting up a Minecraft server is to verify if you have all the prerequisites, be they software or hardware requirements. As for the software, an updated version of Java is highly recommended, and in some instances, required. These can be installed from oracle's website, and try to keep up on updating these as previously mentioned, it is sometimes required to have the latest version of Java (at the time of writing, the version is 15.0.2. You can download it from [Oracle's site](`https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html`).

As for the hardware requirements, they are not too strict, but they restrict what type of server you'll be running. If you don't particularly care for the performance of the server with a couple of players on a vanilla server, you should be fine to skip over this section, but if you're a hardware nerd or would like to learn more on the subject, this will attempt to enlighten you. When choosing parts for a Minecraft server, one should stray away from the higher-core-count CPUs and choose something with better single-threaded performance, as that is nearly all that Minecraft will use. Memory is often one of the most popularly sought after specs in a Server box, however a good computer alone it does not make. When choosing the parts for the computer, put more effort into finding a better CPU with the amount of RAM not as an afterthought, but a second priority. Typically speaking, more memory allows for more players and more mods, but always make sure that your CPU is keeping up with the server itself before trying to throw more memory at the server, as sometimes with more memory comes worse performance due to how java is written.

Once you've figured through the prerequisites, you need to find the best server jar for your requirements; along with this thread there is a [part for choosing a server jar](tutorials/en_us/JARS/FINDING.md), but if you'd rather go the easy route and stick with vanilla, a popular and quite useful to get the server jars from is [mcversions.net](https://mcversions.net/), as that contains legacy files along with newly released versions.
