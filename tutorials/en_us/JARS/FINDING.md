# Intro

Here we will go through how to pick what server jar to use. A server jar contains all the code for the server, there are server jars for modloaders, like forge or fabric, and some that allow you to use plugins.

## Picking your server jar

The first step to finding the right server jar for you is to know what kind of server you want to run, is it survival, prisons, minigames and what Minecraft version is it? We will show you some basic ones then you can look at (link to the page of server jars) for more in-depth explanations etc.

### For MC 1.16.X

If you are planning on creating a survival server for your friend group [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/). Fabric is mostly known for modded servers but you can install basic plugin port mods on server side and optimization mods for making chunks load faster, creating lighting better etc. Theres also mods for essentials port and many more plugins you would need on a regular server...
If instead you are planning on running a public server where you plan to have a **lot of plugins or custom gamemodes** you should go for a spigot fork like [PaperMC](https://papermc.io), or my personal favorite: [Purpur](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur). Purpur has all the optimization, fixes, and features of Paper, Tuinity, Spigot as well as their own features. We really recommend, it's the best fork we know of.

### For MC 1.13+

A good server jar to use is [Purpur](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur), it optimizes performance a lot and adds a lot of features (FLYING SQUIDS :D) to help optimize even further or just some fun cool things to do.

### For MC 1.12 and below

[PaperMC](https://papermc.io) is generally the best fork for these versions and not much more is needed.

**JUST PLEASE DO NOT USE THE VANILLA JAR!**
