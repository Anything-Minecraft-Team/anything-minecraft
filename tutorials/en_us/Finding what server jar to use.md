# Intro

Here we will go through how to pick what server jar to use. A server jar contains all the code for the server, there are server jars for modloaders, like forge or fabric, and some that allow you to use plugins.

## Picking your server jar

The first step to finding the right server jar for you is to know what kind of server you want to run, is it survival, prisons, minigames and what Minecraft version is it? We will show you some basic ones then you can look at (link to the page of server jars) for more in-depth explanations etc.

- 1.16+ - If you sre planning on creating a survival server for your friend group, you can use [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/). Fabric is mostly known for modded servers but you can install basic plugin port mods on server side and optimization mods for making chunks load faster, creating lighting better etc. Theres also mods for essentials port and many more plugins you would need on a regular server...
- 1.13+ and above

  - A good server jar to use is [Purpur](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur), it optimizes performance a lot and adds a lot of features (FLYING SQUIDS :D) to help optimize even further or just some fun cool things to do.
  - Alternateivly, [PaperMC] provides a good simple bukkit like server with great performance and rolling updates on the latest releases provides gameplay fixes before other server packages.

- 1.12 and below - [PaperMC] is generally the best fork for these versions and not much is more is needed.
- 1.0-1.16 - If you use vanilla jar please change something more stable since vanilla jar has much more performance draining and problematic in long term use...

## Fabric Server Side Mods (you can delete or move this somewhere)

I have been using fabric since awhile now and it felt like it has better mob spawning, the mods I used for optimizasion was mostly from [Here](https://gist.github.com/comp500/12417ee3685f6204362e933c9bcde603) except I changed phospor with StarLight, added Helium Fabric mod and didnt use random patches.
